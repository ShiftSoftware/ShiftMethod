# Business as Code

Computers are very premitive machines. Yet with the right sets of instructions (Code), they perform tasks that appear to be extremely complicated. 
 
The same is true for starting and operating a business. It might seem very "Complicated". But with the right set of steps, it's also a very primitive task. 

This repository is aiming to serve as a framework for starting and operating a business.
We're trying to document the steps, requirements, and instructions in great detail.  


# Workforce Anatomy

From the prespective of Software Developer/Engineers, We categorize people into 2 broad categories:

1. **Producer/Creator**: These are the people that **CAN** actually produce/create solutions for problems. They **directly** participate in converting ideas/concepts into tangible products/services. For example: A Software Developer, a Data Scientist, a Graphic Designer, a Video Editor, a Content Writer ...etc
2. **Non-Producers**: These are the people that either **CAN'T** or **can't as efficiently** produce/create. They are not **directly** participating in creating/producing the products/services but their roles are **indirectly** important. For example: Investors, Lawyers, Accountants, Marketing/PR officiers, Activists ...etc 

<br/>

Below is a good rule of thumb for small businesses operating in an **immature** tech market: 
+ **Producers** should be the direct owners and decesion makers.
+ **Non-Producers** should be the ones that assist in executing the plans/decesions.
 
By an **immature** market (Economy) we mean a market that doen'st have many large players (Companies having a capital ranging from a few millions to billions of dollars).


# The Essentials
Below is what's required for starting/operating a small business:

  + Collabration Tool: such as Slack, Jira, Notion ...etc
  + Invoicing/Accounting.
